# Nov 7 — Priorities

1. Add basic social features (follow users, public profiles, view others’ libraries).
2. Improve paper search (fuzzy/typo‑tolerant; partial matches like "original vllm paper").
3. Show richer paper stats in search results (similar to arXiv summary cards).
4. Add personal stats in the dashboard (reading streaks, counts, recent activity).
5. Add lists: "To Read" and "Read" (status management and quick filters).
6. Add reviews: 0–5 star rating and a short text note; prompt after finishing.


Make it easy and frictionless to add papers. this is very veyr important.
